    <meta name="description" content="FantomPixels is a unique NFT project on the Fantom
          Blockchain consisting of 1024 NFTs visually represented on a 32 x 32 grid. Each NFT has 3
          modifiable attributes built in the Smart Contract that appear on the grid â€“ a Title, an Image
          and a Custom URL. Owners of FantomPixels NFTs can update these attributes indefinitely
          and the all the previous attributes are stored on the Fantom Blockchain. The Token ID of
          the NFT corresponds to a 64 x 64 square of pixels where the Image is rendered, Title is
          displayed and the Custom URL is linked for the entire world to see. Be a part of a living
          project on the Fantom Blockchain that transcends time by minting a FantomPixels NFT!" />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
